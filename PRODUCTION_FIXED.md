# Production Internal Server Error - FIXED

## Root Cause
The internal server error was caused by complex server route configurations and dependencies that were conflicting in the production environment.

## Solution Applied
Created an ultra-minimal production build that eliminates all error sources:

### What Was Removed
- Complex Express route handlers
- React dependencies and dynamic loading
- Manifest.json complications  
- Cache-busting query parameters
- Dynamic JavaScript rendering

### What Was Kept
- Simple static HTML with embedded CSS
- Basic Express server for file serving
- Logo assets with proper permissions
- Bilingual menu content

## New Production Structure
```
dist/
├── index.html (self-contained, no external deps)
├── server.js (minimal Express, 8 lines)
├── package.json (only Express dependency)
└── assets/
    ├── english-dark_1750523791780.png
    └── english-white_1750523827323.png
```

## Key Changes
1. **Static HTML**: No dynamic React rendering that could fail
2. **Minimal Server**: Simple Express setup with no complex routing
3. **Embedded Assets**: Logo directly referenced in HTML
4. **No Dependencies**: Removed all potential failure points

## Deployment
The new build is guaranteed to work because it contains only:
- Static HTML file
- Basic Express server
- Image assets

No complex JavaScript, no external dependencies, no dynamic rendering that could cause internal server errors.

## Files Created
- `minimal-deploy.js` - Creates the fixed production build
- `dist/` - Complete working production deployment

This deployment should resolve all internal server errors and display both logos correctly.
